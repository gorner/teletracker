*Teletracker 0.0.3 (July 30, 2013)*

* Add separate per-episode display page
* Basic episode queueing now available, though de-queueing an episode causes some problems (not clear if it's on my end or ember-data's)
* Various other _minor_ fixes

*Teletracker 0.0.2 (June 13, 2013)*

* Switched over to Ember Data (already?!) with fixtures
* "Show" model renamed "Program" to avoid any possibility of confusion / conflicts with "show" routes
* Added (very basic) episodes display

*Teletracker 0.0.1 (June 10, 2013)*

* Initial commit with very basic display of show information using hardcoded data.
