Teletracker
===========

This is a personal Ember.js-based side project I'm working on which will hopefully allow the user to track TV series that they've watched or intend to watch in the future.

As of this writing I've only set up a very basic initial codebase but am intending on developing this further shortly. Further details are available in the CHANGELOG.

Small parts of the project are inspired by an [Ember.js course](http://unspace.ca/embergarten/) I took, which involved a tutorial project named "TimeTracker", though I can only give my most solemn assurances that I'd picked out this name (and even started on a *very* rough version which I later abandoned) well before that course.

Until I get around to connecting an actual API for TV show data, I'm using fixtures derived from the [TVRage API](http://services.tvrage.com/info.php?page=main).
